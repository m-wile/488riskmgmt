## Testing

```{r}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)

# things that make life easier
strd <- "1992-01-01"
codes <- c("1MO", "3MO", "6MO", "1", "2", "5", "7", "10", "20", "30") #these are time frames, fairly intuitive
tickers <- c()
for (i in 1:length(codes)) {
  # DGS is Market Yield on US Treasury Securities with those specific time frames which I believe is what we're after
  tickers <- c(tickers, paste0("DGS", codes[i]))
}

# initial data get
FRED <- tidyquant::tq_get(c(tickers), get = "economic.data", from = strd)
# all manipulation in a different data frame so the pull doesn't have to happen for every little change
# simple computation of daily change in basis points
FRED_data <- FRED %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(symbol) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(BP_delta = price - dplyr::lag(price)) %>% 
  tidyr::drop_na()
  
# graph of everyting
FRED_graph <- plotly::plot_ly(FRED,
                              x = ~date,
                              y = ~price,
                              color = ~symbol,
                              type = "scatter",
                              mode = "lines")
# graph of change in basis points

                                    x = ~date,
                                    y = ~BP_delta,
                                    color = ~symbol,
                                    type = "scatter",

# annoyingly, plotly only goes to 8 colors and of course there's ten. that's all that warning you get when running it is
